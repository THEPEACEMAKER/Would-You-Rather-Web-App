// Middleware intercepts a dispatched action before it reaches the reducer.
// You can only add middleware when you initially create the store:

export default applyMiddleware(
	// The middleware is called in the order it is listed in this function.
  thunk,
  logger,
)

/*
Each thing returned by an action creator - be it an action or a function - will go through our thunk middleware.
If the thunk middleware sees an action, that action will be sent to the next middleware in line - the logger middleware.
If it sees a function, the thunk middleware will call that function.
That function can contain side effects - such as API calls - and dispatch actions, simple Javascript objects.
These dispatched actions will again go to all of the middleware.
The thunk middleware will see that itâ€™s a simple action and pass the action on to the next middleware, the logger.*/
